## Introduction  
In this lab, I learned how to use Git, Github, and Github Desktop in order to use the website in different ways, including merging pull requests and creating repositories by pulling information from Arduino IDE.  

## Benefits of Using Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop  
- **Git** provides version control, allowing people to track changes, collaborate, and revert to previous versions when needed.  
- **GitHub** helps with collaboration by allowing us to use repositories online, helping teams work together seamlessly and manage projects effectively.  
- **GitHub Desktop** simplifies Git with a user-friendly interface, making it easier to manage commits, branches, and pull requests without using the command line.  

## Conclusion  
Using Git, GitHub, and GitHub Desktop improves productivity, collaboration, and code management, making work smoother and more efficient.
